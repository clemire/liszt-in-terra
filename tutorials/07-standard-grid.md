Part of what makes Ebb unique is the ability to handle simulations over very different domains.  In the previous tutorials, other than the hello world, we used a triangle mesh domain.  In this tutorial, we look at how to make use of the standard grid library.

```
import 'ebb'
local L = require 'ebblib'

local GridLib   = require 'ebb.domains.grid'

local vdb       = require 'ebb.lib.vdb'
```

We start the program more or less identically, except we pull in the grid domain library instead of the OFF loader wrapper

```
local N = 40

local grid = GridLib.NewGrid2d {
  size   = {N, N},
  origin = {-N/2, -N/2},
  width  = {N, N},
  periodic_boundary = {true,false},
}
```

Now, instead of loading the domain from a file, we can simply create the grid by specifying a set of named arguments.  For a 2d grid, these are:

  - *size* is the discrete dimensions of the grid; i.e. how many
      cells there are in the x and y directions. (here it is 40x40)
  - *origin* is the spatial position of the (0,0) corner of the grid.
      (here we put the center of the grid at coordinate (0,0))
  - *width* is the spatial dimensions of the grid (which we just
      put in 1-to-1 correspondence with the discrete dimension here)
  - *periodic_boundary* is a list of flags indicating whether the
      given dimension should "wrap-around" or be treated as a hard
      boundary.  (This argument is assumed to be {false,false} if
      not supplied) (Here, we set only the x direction to wrap around)

```
local timestep    = L.Constant(L.double, 0.45)
local conduction  = L.Constant(L.double, 1.0)
local max_diff    = L.Global(L.double, 0.0)

grid.cells:NewField('t', L.double):Load(0)
grid.cells:NewField('new_t', L.double):Load(0)

local function init_temperature(x_idx, y_idx)
  if x_idx == 4 and y_idx == 6 then return 1000
                               else return 0 end
end
grid.cells.t:Load(init_temperature)
```

Our definition of simulation quantities is more or less the same as for the triangle mesh.  The one difference to remark on is that we define fields over `grid.cells` instead of `mesh.vertices`.

```
local ebb visualize ( c : grid.cells )
  vdb.color({ 0.5 * c.t + 0.5, 0.5-c.t, 0.5-c.t })
  var p2 = c.center
  vdb.point({ p2[0], p2[1], 0 })
end
```

Unsurprisingly, this means that the visualization code is also similar. However, because cells have spatial extent, it doesn't make sense to simply look up their position.  Instead, we ask for their `c.center` coordinates.  (Warning: center is not actually a field, so if you try to write to it, e.g. `c.center = {3,4}` you'll get an error)

```
local ebb update_temperature ( c : grid.cells )
  var avg   = (1.0/4.0) * ( c(1,0).t + c(-1,0).t + c(0,1).t + c(0,-1).t )
  var diff  = avg - c.t
  c.new_t   = c.t + timestep * conduction * diff
end
```

Our new temperature update step is similar to the double-buffer strategy from Tutorial 06, but we use the special grid mechanism for neighbor access.  Here, we get the temperature from the four neighbors of a cell in the positive and negative x and y directions.  In general, we can get the cell offset from the current one by (x,y) by writing `c(x,y)` and then access any fields on that cell.

```
local ebb measure_max_diff ( c : grid.cells )
  var avg   = (1.0/4.0) * ( c(1,0).t + c(-1,0).t + c(0,1).t + c(0,-1).t )
  var diff  = avg - c.t
  max_diff  max= L.fabs(diff)
end
```

The function to measure the maximum difference is essentially the same.

```
local ebb update_temp_boundaries ( c : grid.cells )
  var avg : L.double
  if c.yneg_depth > 0 then
    avg = (1.0/4.0) * ( c(1,0).t + c(-1,0).t + c(0,1).t + c(0,0).t )
  elseif c.ypos_depth > 0 then
    avg = (1.0/4.0) * ( c(1,0).t + c(-1,0).t + c(0,0).t + c(0,-1).t )
  end
  var diff  = avg - c.t
  c.new_t   = c.t + timestep * conduction * diff
end
```

However, simply applying `update_temperature` is insufficient to handle the non-periodic boundaries in the y-direction.  Instead, we're going to need to somehow impose a boundary condition on our simulation.

By default, a non-periodic direction marks one final layer of cells on each side of the grid as part of the boundary.  Then we can query how deep we are into a particular boundary using `c.yneg_depth` and `c.ypos_depth`. (Note that like `c.center` these "fields" can't be assigned to)

```
for i=1,360 do
  grid.cells.interior:foreach(update_temperature)
  grid.cells.boundary:foreach(update_temp_boundaries)
  grid.cells:Swap('t', 'new_t')

  vdb.vbegin()
  vdb.frame()
    grid.cells:foreach(visualize)
  vdb.vend()

  if i % 10 == 0 then -- measure statistics every 10 steps
    max_diff:set(0)
    grid.cells.interior:foreach(measure_max_diff)
    print( 'iteration #'..tostring(i), 'max gradient: ', max_diff:get() )
  end
end
```

Our simulation loop is mostly the same, but with one major difference.  Rather than run `update_temperature` for each cell, we only run it for each `interior` cell.  Likewise, we then execute the boundary computation only for each boundary cell.  Though we still visualize all the cells with a single call.  (Note that if we ran `update_temperature` on all of the cells, then we would produce array out of bound errors.)
