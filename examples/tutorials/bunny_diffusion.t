-- Now We want to construct the Liszt relations
-- The 'L' namespace is available because of the
-- initial 'import "compiler.liszt"' statement at the top of this file

local triangles = L.NewRelation(n_tris, 'triangles')
local vertices  = L.NewRelation(n_verts, 'vertices')

-- The first parameter to the L.NewRelation call tells it how
-- many rows we'd like the relation to have.

-- The second parameter to the L.NewRelation call tells it what
-- name we're going to refer to the relation with.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Once we've constructed the relations, we can define
-- Fields over them.

vertices:NewField('pos', L.vector(L.double, 3))

-- The preceding line defines a new field over the vertices,
-- named 'pos'.  It stores vectors of 3 doubles each.
-- We can load the position data we read from the files into
-- this field.

vertices.pos:Load(position_data_array)


triangles:NewField('v1', L.row(vertices))
triangles:NewField('v2', vertices)
triangles:NewField('v3', vertices)

-- Now we've defined 3 new fields on the triangles, each of which
-- refers to one of the three vertices for a triangle.
-- We've explicitly typed the first field 'v1' with the type
--    L.row(vertices)
-- A Row type is similar to a pointer.  It means that field 'v1' refers
-- to a row from the relation 'vertices'.  As a shorthand, if you
-- type a field using a relation, then the type is automatically
-- inferred to be a Row type.  (We did this for 'v2' and 'v3')

triangles.v1:Load(v1_data_array)
triangles.v2:Load(v2_data_array)
triangles.v3:Load(v3_data_array)

-- Row data can be loaded just like the position data.
-- Let's look at the first call to load Field 'v1'.
-- 
-- 'v1_data_array' should be an array of length triangles:Size()
-- Each entry of 'v1_data_array' should be an integer identifying
-- some row of the 'vertices' relation to refer to.  So these integers
-- should be at least 0 and less than (vertices:Size() - 1).

-- WARNING: If you try to load Row fields with new data after the simulation
--    begins, you may get undefined behavior.  Liszt reserves the right
--    to arbitrarily re-order the rows during execution.  This may happen
--    to improve data access patterns, due to the creation or destruction
--    of data, or any other number of contingencies!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Having defined and loaded all of the data from file, we can now
-- go ahead and define the simulation specific Fields.

-- define a temperature field.  Initialize it using a callback.
-- The callback is written in Lua.
vertices:NewField('temperature', L.double)
vertices.temperature:Load(function(index)
  if index == 0 then return 3000.0 else return 0.0 end
end)

-- define a triangle area field.  Initialize it to '0'.
-- We'll compute the triangle areas soon!
triangles:NewField('area', L.double)
triangles.area:Load(0)

-- It'll also be useful for us to know how many triangles touch
-- each vertex later.  So let's record that too.
vertices:NewField('nTriangles', L.int)
vertices.nTriangles:Load(0)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- In addition to Fields, we can also define Globals.
-- A Liszt Global is a kind of "global" variable that's useful for
-- controlling time-step behavior or computing simple summary statistics
-- Unlike Fields, which have a different value for each entry/row in the
-- relation, Globals have exactly one value visible to all rows.

local timestep = L.NewGlobal(L.double, 1.0)
-- The preceding line set up a Global named timestep of type L.double
-- and gave it initial value 1.0

timestep:setTo(0.45)
-- Then this line set the value using the method :setTo(...)

print( 'the timestep is ' .. tostring(timestep:value()) )
-- We can retreive the value of a global with the :value() method

-- NOTE: Globals have to be explicitly written and read from Lua code.

local avg_temp_change = L.NewGlobal(L.double, 0.0)
-- We'll use this second global to measure the average change in
-- temperature as we run our simulation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Before we launch into the full computation, we'll take a second
-- here to compute the triangles' areas.  We can do this in Liszt.
-- Let's see how...

-- This first line declares that we're defining a new Liszt Kernel.
--  (You can think of a kernel as a parallel-for loop!)
local compute_tri_area = liszt kernel ( t : triangles )
-- We specify that the kernel will be mapped over rows from the 'triangles'
-- relation, and that we'll refer to rows using the variable name 't'.

  -- First, we'll go ahead and name the 3 vertices' position vectors
  var p1 : L.vector(L.double, 3) = t.v1.pos
  var p2 = t.v2.pos
  var p3 = t.v3.pos
  -- The first line declares a new variable 'p1' with type
  --    L.vector(L.double, 3)
  -- Then, we initialize it to value t.v1.pos,
  -- the position of the first vertex of triangle t
  -- We omit the explicit type from the following two declarations b/c
  -- it can be inferred automatically.

  -- Now, we'll go ahead and use a standard formula for the computation of
  -- triangle area
  var normal = L.cross((p2 - p1), (p3 - p1))
  var area   = 0.5 * L.length(normal)

  -- Finally, we'll store the result into the 'area' field on the triangle
  t.area = area

end

-- Once we've defined a kernel, then we can apply it to the relation
-- it was designed for.  Here, that's triangles
compute_tri_area(triangles)

-- Now triangles.area has the values we want computed for it.

-- We can compute the number of triangles touching each vertex
-- using another Liszt Kernel
local compute_n_triangles = liszt kernel ( t : triangles )
  t.v1.nTriangles += 1
  t.v2.nTriangles += 1
  t.v3.nTriangles += 1
end

compute_n_triangles(triangles)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- We're going to simulate a heat diffusion on the triangle-mesh
-- So, let's go ahead and define a conduction constant
local conduction = 1.0

-- Note that we didn't define conduction as a Global.  As a result, it will
-- be compiled into the Liszt Kernel.  If we later change the value of
-- conduction, it will have no effect.  If we wanted to change the
-- conduction over the course of the simulation, then we should have
-- created a Global.


-- In order to get access to trigonometric functions and other C code,
-- we include the C file like this
local cmath = terralib.includecstring [[
#include <math.h>
]]
-- notice the double square brackets.  In Lua, double square brackets
-- are used to write a multi-line string.



-- Let's first look at one way we could try writing heat diffusion
-- as a single Liszt Kernel.  It turns out it will produce compiler
-- errors if we try to execute it.
-- ( TRY IT OUT!  Just uncomment the code below, and you should
--        get a compiler error when you try to execute this file. )

-- Why won't the code above work?

-- Remember when we said you can think of a Liszt Kernel as a parallel-for
-- loop?  Suppose we looped over the triangles in two different ways:
-- front-to-back and back-to-front.  Would the result of the loop be
-- the same?  No, because each loop iteration both READs from the

-- (via the += operator).

-- We can avoid this problem by storing intermediate results into

-- Having finished the simulation, we'd like to write this data to disk

  },
  file      = PN.scriptdir() .. "simple_trimesh_diffusion_output",
  notes     = "These are some example notes being stored",
}
-- The L.SaveRelationSchema call takes a table of arguments.  These are...
  -- relations - a Lua table of all the relations we want to save.
  --             We name each of these relations.  For example, if we had
  --             written {
  --                my_triangles = triangles, ...
  --             }
  --             then the triangles relation would be saved to disk with
  --             the name 'my_triangles' instead.
  -- file ------ a string or pathname identifying the directory to
  --             save the relations to.  We recommend creating a new
  --             directory for each set of saved relations.
  -- notes ----- a string to be saved along with the rest of the data.
  --             These notes are a good place to leave little reminders
  --             for yourself about what this file is / is for.
  --             Use them however you wish!

-- Look at what got written to disk.  You should see a new directory.
-- Inside it, everything will be organized like this
--  simple_trimesh_diffusion_output/
--      schema.json
--      vertices/
--          pos.field
--          temperature.field
--          d_temperature.field
--          nTriangles.field
--      triangles/
--          v1.field
--          v2.field
--          v3.field
--          area.field
--
-- The schema.json file is a human-readable text-file using a format
-- called JSON.  The schema file defines what relations are saved in
-- this directory, how many rows are in each relation, and which fields
-- are present on each relation, along with their type.
-- For each field, an address is stored in the schema.json file pointing
-- to the *.field file storing the data for that field.
-- The *.field files are binary files which are simply arrays of data
-- with a brief header to help read the file.

-- In order to load all of these relations back into Liszt, we simply
-- execute the following call:
local loaded_data = L.LoadRelationSchema {
  file = PN.scriptdir() .. "simple_trimesh_diffusion_output"
}
-- The call will automatically look for a schema.json file, and then
-- follow the directions there to load in all the field data.


-- This save/load feature can be used to checkpoint the simulation, etc.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- We can also dump data out of the relational storage.
-- BEWARE: Liszt may re-order your data however it chooses.
-- This means that you need to dump out everything, not just
-- a single field.

-- EXAMPLE:
-- the vertices may not be in the same order, so if we dumped out
-- the temperature field and then read in the original OFF file along
-- with the dumped temperatures in another program, there's no guarantee
-- that the temperatures will be associated with the correct vertices.
-- To avoid this problem, we should dump out all of the fields and
-- construct a new version of the OFF file.


-- DumpToList() is the inverse of the way we loaded the OFF file data
local positions     = vertices.pos:DumpToList()
